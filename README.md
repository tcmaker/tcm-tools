# TCM Tools
This repo contains scripts and small tools developed against TCM services that do not really have a home other places but we would like to make sure stay around and do not become a "Didn't someone write a script to do that once??" story.

## Contributing
If you are adding a tool to this repo:
1. Create a new folder under the root here that is named the same as your tool or script
1. Put all of your tool/script files within that folder
1. Create a proper `README.md` file for your script so that others know how to use it. It needs to live in root folder for your script.

### Example
I am adding a script called `my-script` so I do these steps

1. I create a folder in the root of this project called `my-script` (so `~/git/tcm-tools/my-script` would be the relative path)
1. I add my script to the `my-script` folder
1. I create a readme file at `tcm-tools/my-script/README.md` and fill it out with all the necessary information on what the script is for and how to use it
